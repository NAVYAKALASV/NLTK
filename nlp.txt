Penny was a little girl who lived in Alaska. It was ice-cold there. wait waited waiting waiter waits. 
She kept praying that she could play in the lush, green and warm gardens like we do but of course, she couldn't. 
Her father, like all the men there, didn't have a job. He hunted seals and caught fishes as was the custom. 
So her father hadn't even heard of money and even if he had money, there weren't any aeroplanes to take them abroad. 
Now somewhere near Penny's house was a deep, dark forest. 
Everyone was afraid to enter it. They said that whoever entered it would be sucked in by a great hole. 
One day, Penny was playing with her Eskimo friends when one of the boys shouted,"Hey, I dare one of you to enter the magic forest." 
No one dared. Penny picked up a twig and threw it at the edge of the forest. Nothing happened. 
Penny was astonished. It's all a legend! We can play hide and seek in the woods if we want, she thought. 
She walked slowly towards the woods. It was getting colder and colder she took each step. She walked right into the middle of the forest.
